TO DO:

* Make text-input upper-casing an app callback
* Use modules
* How to encapsulate: include CSS as well? Needs to come from the app ...
* Props more generally; button colors, minimally
* Fix isInteger(3.4) b04k
* Dropdown options specified within JS?
* Lots of assertions
* Better way to surface errors
* Maybe fold in jko-toggler?
* Learn more about CSS -- sharpen how theming works

Notes on React:

* Props: immutable, owned by the parent component, passed down to children
* State: mutable, owned by the component itself
